Midway through the year he compiled a passer rating of 120.5 and threw for over 2500 yards, and the chiefs were in prime position to finish first in the AFC. A string of bad losses, along with some back cramps from Mahomes, caused the Chiefs' and Mahomes' play to suffer, and they lost 5 games in a row, including a demolishing by Brock Purdy and the 49ers. Brock Purdy's stellar second half of the season catapulted him into the MVP race, where he eventually took the throne and was crowned the NFL MVP. Bettors lost millions of dollars in predicting that Mahomes would continue his strong play, but quickly realized they should have bet on the best quarterback in the NFL, Brock Purdy.",
